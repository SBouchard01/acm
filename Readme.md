### Alternative Clustering Methods -- a common analysis pipeline for DESI

To install in Perlmutter in developer mode, within the cosmodesi environment:

    source /global/common/software/desi/users/adematti/cosmodesi_environment.sh main
    cd acm
    python setup.py develop --user

Note: the `--user` flag is important -- it ensures that installation takes place in your own directories.
