# Emulating the galaxy clustering



## Optmizing the emulator

The optimization of the emulator is done with `optuna`. The summary of the optimization is stored in a `optuna` directory, in a `<statistic>.pkl` file.
This file contains the `optuna` study object, which can be used to retrieve the best parameters of the model.

## Testing the emulator output
